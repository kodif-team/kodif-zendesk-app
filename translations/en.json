    "long_description": "Kodif is a low-code platform that lets non-technical teams build powerful self-serve CX flows. \n\nMeet your customers where they are and help them resolve their issues over the channel of their preference, be it web or mobile forms, chat, or email. \n\n**Benefits of Kodif:**\n- Easily build powerful self-service flows to reduce costs and scale the customer support effectively. To build flows, visit www.kodif.io or schedule a demo if you are a new customer.\n- Self-service resolutions significantly reduce customer effort and lead to a higher customer experience and reduced churn\n- Agents are humans, and often they go off the scripts. Self-serve flows make sure you provide consistent customer support with no room for error.\n\n\n**Zendesk App features:**\n- Help your agents solve the tickets faster and more consistently by showing the Kodif flows within your Zendesk Agent UI.\n- Resolve customer issues directly by surfacing the Kodif flows on your Zendesk Help Center.\n\nNote that this app is not required to integrate Kodif flows with Zendesk (e.g. to create a zendesk ticket from within a flow). It is only needed if you would like to use Agent Assistant and Help Center self-service flows.",
    "installation_instructions": "**For new customers:** Sign up for a demo to learn how Kodif can help you easily build self-service flows.\n\n**For existing customers:** Install the app from the marketplace to enable self-service flows within your Zendesk Help Center. Plus, if you have agent-facing flows, you can enable Agent Assistant within Zendesk Agent Workspace."
